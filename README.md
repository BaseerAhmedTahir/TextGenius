## The Problem
The web is full of complex information. Users often face barriers due to difficult language, information overload, or language differences. Cloud-based AI tools can help, but they compromise user privacy, have potential costs, and fail without an internet connection.

## Our Solution: TextGenius
TextGenius solves this by running 100% on the user's device. It offers:
- **100% Privacy:** User data and selected text never leave the machine.
- **Offline Functionality:** All core features work without an internet connection.
- **Zero Cost:** No server costs or API keys are required.
- **Universal Access:** Works across the entire web, not just within a single application.

## Features & APIs Used
- **Summarize (Summarizer API):** Instantly get key points from long articles or selected text.
- **Explain Like I'm 5 (Prompt API):** Simplify complex topics using an advanced system prompt.
- **Rewrite (Rewriter API):** Change the tone of text to be simpler, more formal, or more casual.
- **Translate (Translator API):** Translate text with auto-detection of the source language and a user-friendly UI to select the target language.
- **Quiz Generator (Prompt API):** Generate comprehension quizzes from any block of text.
